= kafkaStreamsDemo

This demo gives a brief overview about common use cases of kafka streams applications.

* demo expects local kafka running (localhost:9092)
** you can use `startKafka.sh` and `startZoo.sh` in scripts folder

== steps

. open project in an IDE
. open a terminal and go to the scripts folder of this repository
. run `./startZoo.sh` for starting zookeeper
. run `./startKafka.sh` for starting kafka
. run `./createDemoTopics.sh` to create all needed topics
. run `./listTopics.sh`
** you should see something like this:
costs +
normalized-logs +
raw-logs +
task-duration +
. run main method of class LogGenerator
** run `./consumeTopic.sh raw-logs raw-logs` to listen to raw-logs, you should see log lines coming in
. run main method of class CostProducer
. run main method of class LogStream
** now you can check how the messages are transformed
** `./consumeTopic.sh normalized-logs` shows the normalized messages in json format
** `./consumeLong.sh count-tasks` shows the task count per language within a 5min time window
** `./consumeTopic.sh task-duration` shows the duration of each task
** `./consumeLong.sh task-costs` shows the costs for each task (this is done using a join)
